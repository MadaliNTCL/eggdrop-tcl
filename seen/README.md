<a name="installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
To install this script you have to copy it to your /scripts/ directory and add <b>source scripts/seen.tcl</b> to the bottom of your eggdrop.conf:<p>
It is recommended not to have too many scripts running on the same bots. Try to use a bot for a task, and another for a different task<p>
